Facial-Recognition-Python-webcam-haarcascade
Project we did with Henri Kauppila to recognize our faces. We used this youtube tutorial as a staring point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jz24sVsLE4

I recommend doing this project in virtual environment.
I used Anaconda to make virtual environment and then did coding with Spyder using Python 2.7

How to run this:
1. Run datasetCreator.py file to capture images of some face you want to recognize, give it id number you want
2. Run trainer.py to train the model to recognize the faces you just created using datasetCreator.py file
3. Run detector.py file to try your model. It should now recognize the trained faces
