"# Facial-Recognition-Python-webcam-haarcascade" 
Project we did with Henri Kauppila to recognize our faces. We used this youtube tutorial as a staring point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jz24sVsLE4

I recommend doing this project in virtual machine. 
I used Anaconda to make virtual environment and then did coding with Spyder using Python 2.7
